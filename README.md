### Waveform Generator DIY

This project started when I needed to use a waveform generator on my electronics bench, but I didn't have this instrument. So I thought I'd build one to use in my personal projects. My first step was to come up with a list of requirements of what I wanted this equipment to be able to do. This list of requirements is shown below:

|  | **Requirements list** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | I would like the equipment to have a square wave output. | <ul><li>- [x] </li> |
| 2 | I would like the equipment to have a sine wave output. | <ul><li>- [x] </li> |
| 3 | I would like the equipment to have a triangle wave output. | <ul><li>- [x] </li> |
| 4 | I would like the equipment to have frequency adjustment. | <ul><li>- [ ] </li> |
| 5 | I would like the equipment to have amplitude adjustment. | <ul><li>- [ ] </li> |
| 6 | I would like the equipment to have a user interface. | <ul><li>- [ ] </li> |
| 7 | I would like to configure the equipment using the user interface. | <ul><li>- [ ] </li> |
